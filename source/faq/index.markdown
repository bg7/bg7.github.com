## requirements ##

#### What software do I need for running bg7? ####

We strive to keep dependencies at a minimum: to run bg7 you just need

* **Java** a fairly recent `x64` JVM, anything above `1.6` is ok. You can get installers of oracle/Sun JDK-6u27 for a plethora of platforms from [Oracle jdk download website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u27-download-440405.html)

* **BLAST** we recommend `blast+ 2.2.25`, you can get precompiled binaries from the [NCBI blast ftp site](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)

#### what about hardware requirements? ####

With the current version, you just need a considerable amount of RAM: anything above `64GB` is ok. Obviously, this means you need a `64bit` OS.

_Yes!_ but remember that you need to provide bg7 source code +  source code of any modifications, software using bg7, etc to your users. See [Selling Free Softare - GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html).

### why this is important? ###

Well, itâ€™s key for the subject matter. AGPLv3 means that if you are using bg7, you gain
