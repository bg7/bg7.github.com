## requirements ##

### What software do I need for running bg7? ###

We strive to keep dependencies at a minimum: to run bg7 you just need

* **Java** a fairly recent `x64` JVM, anything above `1.6` is ok [oracle/Sun JDK 6u27 download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u27-download-440405.html)

* **BLAST** we recommend `blast+ 2.2.25`, you can get precompiled binaries from the [NCBI blast ftp site](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)

### what about hardware requirements? ###




## open source ##

We truly believe in open source; but we enjoy more doing things than writing long, grandiose manifests about open science, open data, whatever. So, bg7 is as open source as you can get: AGPLv3 licensed.

### AGPL _-what?_ ###

This is `GPLv3` + further copyleft restrictions.

### why this is important? ###

Well, itâ€™s key for the subject matter. AGPLv3 means that if you are using bg7, you gain

* no lock-in you have all present and future bg7 code
* etc etc
