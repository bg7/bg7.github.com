#### the people behind bg7 ####

Most of the time it feels better to communicate with real people. Fortunately, there are lots of ways of getting in touch with the people behind bg7. As general guidelines:

* _biology stuff:_ [Raquel Tobes](http://mendeley.com/profiles/raquel-tobes): [@raqueltobes](http://twitter.com/raqueltobes) on twitter || [Marina Manrique](http://marinamanrique.name), [@marina_manrique](http://twitter.com/marina_manrique) on twitter,
* _code:_ [Pablo Pareja](http://http://about.me/pablopareja), [@pablopareja](http://twitter.com/pablopareja) 
* _aws/cloud/IT things:_ [Eduardo Pareja-Tobes](http://eduardo.pareja-tobes.name), [@eparejatobes](http://twitter.com/eparejatobes) on twitter.

Or just take a look at [who did what](/who-did-what): that should give you more info about who to contact for what you have in mind.
