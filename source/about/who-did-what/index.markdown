bg7 is brought to you by [Oh no sequences!](http://ohnosequences.com), the R&D group at [era7 bioinformatics](http://era7bioinformatics.com). 

## people ##

- [**Raquel Tobes**](http://mendeley.com/profiles/raquel-tobes)	| did all of the thinking from a biological standpoint, plus most of algorithm design. The woman behind bg7!
- [**Pablo Pareja**](http://about.me/pablopareja) | coded everything, just by himself!
- [**Marina Manrique**](http://marinamanrique.me) | helped Raquel with the biology stuff. After _lots_ of annotated genomes, she really knows how to _use_ bg7.
- [**Eduardo Pareja-Tobes**](http://eduardo.pareja-tobes.name) | did the cloud stuff and the cool website you're reading now.
