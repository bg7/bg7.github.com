we do all bg7 development on github: everything bg7-related is under the [bg7 organization](http://github.com/bg7/).

#### repositories ####

* [bg7/bg7](http://github.com/bg7/bg7) _- the name says it all: code for bg7 core lives here_
* [bg7/bg7viewer](http://github.com/bg7/bg7viewer) _- a flex-based viewer for bg7 output_
* [bg7/bg7.github.com](http://github.com/bg7/bg7.github.com) _- this website you're viewing; markdown sources in the `source` branch, octopress-generated website in `master`_

 We follow what is usually called [nvie's branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/): if you see a plethora of strangely-named branches, read that and you'll get a clearer picture.
