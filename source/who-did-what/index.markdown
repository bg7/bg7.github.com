## people ##

- [**Raquel Tobes**](http://mendeley.com/profiles/raquel-tobes)	:: did all of the thinking from a biological standpoint, plus most of algorithm design. The woman behind bg7!
- [**Pablo Pareja**](http://http://about.me/pablopareja) :: coded everything, just by himself!
- [**Marina Manrique**](http://marinamanrique.name) :: helped Raquel with the biology stuff. After _lots_ of annotated genomes, she really knows how to _use_ bg7.
- [**Eduardo Pareja-Tobes**](http://eduardo.pareja-tobes.name) :: did the cloud stuff and the cool website you're reading now.
