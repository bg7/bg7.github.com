We truly believe in open source; but we enjoy more doing things than writing long, grandiose manifests about open science, open data, whatever. So,  bg7 is as open source as you can get: AGPLv3 licensed: [_Affero General Public License v3_](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).

In short, this is a modified version of GPLv3, adding a clause requiring that the complete source code be made available to any network user of the AGPL-licensed work. And, if you want the shortest version:

- AGPLv3: the most viral, strong copyleft license. 

Here's a nice explanation of AGPLv3, in terms of what you can do with AGPLv3 code

### what about dual-licensing? ###

We don't like dual licensing; let's say that it is at the very least confusing. So, bg7 is and will remain open source, AGPLv3-licensed. There will never be a commercial license.
