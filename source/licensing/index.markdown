bg7 license is `AGPLv3`, [_Affero General Public License v3_](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html). In short, this is a modified version of GPLv3, adding a clause requiring that the complete source code be made available to any network user of the AGPL-licensed work. And, if you want the shortest version:

{% blockquote %}
	`AGPLv3`: the most viral, strong copyleft license. 
{% endblockquote %}

Here's a nice explanation of AGPLv3, interms of what you can do with AGPLv3 code

### what about dual-licensing? ###

We don't like dual licensing; let's say that it is at the very least confusing. So,

{% blockquote Oh no Sequences!, bg7 licensing %}
bg7 is and *will remain* open source, AGPLv3-licensed. There will *never* be a commercial license
{% endblockquote %}
