#### introduction ####

* [how it works](how-it-works) _- design, approach, overall view_
* [introductory slideshow](cambridge-06-2011-slides) _- slides from a talk at Applied Bioinformatics & Public Health Microbiology 2011_
* [FAQ](/faq/) _- not really documentation, but it's worth taking a look_

#### using BG7

* [install bg7](install) there's really no such thing, as BG7 is just a jar. The only prerequisites/dependencies are a JVM and BLAST.
* [BG7 wiki](http://github.com/bg7/bg7/wiki) _- BG7 project wiki with more documentation_
