### the people behind bg7 ###

Most of the time it feels better to communicate with real people. Fortunately, there are lots of ways of getting in touch with the people behind bg7. As general guidelines:

* _biology stuff:_ [Raquel Tobes](), [Marina Manrique]()
* _code:_ [Pablo Pareja]()
* _aws/cloud/IT things:_ [Eduardo Pareja-Tobes](http://eduardo.pareja-tobes.name)

Or just take a look at [who did what](who-did-what): that should give you more info about who to contact for what you have in mind.
