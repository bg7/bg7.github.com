<p> 
	BG7 is an open source bacterial genome annotation system, specifically designed for NGS data. 
</p>
<p>
	It is the result of years of practical experience: we at <a href="http://era7bioinformatics.com"><b>era7 bioinformatics</b></a> have been annotating bacterial genomes since the days when <code>454 GS20</code> was something <em>new</em>. Given the shortcomings of ORF prediction style annotation systems when applied to NGS data, we decided that it was best to start from scratch and design something with a different approach.
</p>
<p>
	We used it to <a href="https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/">annotate</a> all of the publicly released genome data from the 2011 E. coli EHEC outbreak, yielding the best annotations by far.
</p>	 
<p>
	So, summing up
	<blockquote>
		If you need a no-dependencies, open source, battle-tested annotation system for bacterial genomes, BG7 might be what at you want.
